Stereo tracks consume memory twice as fast as Mono tracks.
<br><br>
The <b>Mixer</b> page lets you record mono tracks to conserve memory and disk space, but still generate stereo audio output.
<br><br>
To begin recording to this track, press the record button <img align=center src="recbut.gif">,
and then press the stop button <img align=center src="stopbut.gif"> when you are ready to stop recording.
<br><br>
With the left mouse down, drag the mouse over the sound window to select part of it.
<br>
If nothing is selected, any of the following operations affect the entire track.
<br>
To hear only the selected sound, 
press the <b>Play Selection</b> button.
<br>
To copy the contents of an audio (.WAV) file into this track,
select the <b>Import Audio from...</b> from the <b><u>F</u>ile</b> menu.
A private copy of the file is made, so that any changes you make will not
affect the imported file.
<br>
To copy the selected sound to the clipboard, 
select <b>Copy</b> from the <b><u>E</u>dit</b> menu.
<br>
To paste the contents of the clipboard into the song, click the mouse where you want to insert the new sound, and
select one of the following from the <b><u>E</u>dit</b> menu:
<dir>
<li>
<b>Paste Over</b> if you want the audio in the clipboard to replace sound on the current track.
For example, if the clipboard contains 1 second of audio, and the song's current position is 0:10:00 (10 seconds), then
the current track from 0:10:00 to 0:11:00 is replaced with the contents of the clipboard.
<li>
<b>Paste Mix</b> if you want the clipboard to be mixed with the current track.
Paste Mix reduces the volume, preventing the possibility of distortion.
If you want to preserve the volume and accept the possibility of distortion,
hold the Shift key while selecting the Paste Mix menu item.
<li>
<b>Paste Insert</b> if you want the clipboard inserted into the current song.
</dir>
To delete the selected part of the track,
select <b>Delete</b> from the <b><u>E</u>dit</b> menu.
<br>
To set the selected part of the track to complete silence,
select <b>Silent</b> from the <b><u>E</u>dit</b> menu.
<br>
To replace the selected sound with the same sound played backward,
select <b>Reverse</b> from the <b><u>E</u>dit</b> menu 

<br><br>
To filter the entire track, press the <b>Filter...</b> button.  If you only want to filter part of
the track, select the desired time period with the mouse, and then press the Filter button.
<br><br>
To eliminate clicks and pops from the start or end of an audio track,
press the <b>Filter...</b> button and set the filter kind to <b>Zero-Average</b>.
<br>
Then, press <b>Filter...</b> again and set the filter kind to <b>Normalize</b>.
<br>
Then, if there is a high-pitch hiss, press <b>Filter...</b> again and set the filter kind to <b>Low-Pass</b>.
<br>
Then, if there is a low-pitched hum, press <b>Filter...</b> again and set the filter kind to <b>High-Pass</b>.
<br><br>
To change the volume of the entire track, or a selected part of the track, press the <b>Volume...</b> button.
As a short-cut, you can make the track, or part of it, twice as loud by pressing the <b>Louder</b> button.
You can adjust the audio volume without modifying the audio signal by turning to the <b>Mixer</b> page.
<br>
To adjust the pitch of the entire track, or a selected part of the track, press the <b>Pitch...</b> button.
<br>
To help you synchronize with recorded MIDI instruments, vertical
<i>tempo</i>   
lines are drawn at the start of each 16th note, quarter note, and measure.
<br><br>
If you make a mistake while recording Audio, you can <b><i>Punch In</i></b>, or re-record
over the mistake as follows.
<dir>
<li>Select the part of the recording you would like to re-record.
<li>Select <b>Set Record + Play Start + End Times</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu
(or click on the top of the <img align=bottom src="starttim.jpg"> field),
and set the Start/End times.  This lets you control the positions where song
playing and recording start and stop.
<li>Position the cursor several seconds before the part you want to record over.
<li>Press the <b>Mix</b> button so that there will be no delay when the
<img align=center src="recbut.gif">
button is pressed.
<li>Press the <b>VU</b> button so the Sound Card is <i>warmed up</i>.
<li>Press the
<img align=center src="recbut.gif">
button.
<li>Sing or play along with the song.
<li>Recording will automatically stop when the end of the selection is reached,
and only the selected <i>punch-in</i> range will be captured.
</dir>
<br><br>
<br>Clicking at the bottom of the field lets you
change time time units to Audio Samples, giving you the most precise control over this selection.
