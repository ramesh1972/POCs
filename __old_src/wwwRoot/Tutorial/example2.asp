Creating an ASP Page
An Active Server Pages (ASP) file is a text file with the extension .asp that contains any combination of the following:

Text 
HTML tags 
Server-side scripts 
A quick way to create an .asp file is to rename your HTML files by replacing the existing .htm or .html file name extension with an .asp extension. If your file does not contain any ASP functionality, then the server dispenses with the ASP script processing and efficiently sends the file to the client. As a Web developer, this affords you tremendous flexibility because you can assign your files .asp extensions, even if you do not plan on adding ASP functionality until later
