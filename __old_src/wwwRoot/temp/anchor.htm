3.2	External Interface Requirements

3.2.1	User Interfaces

As the portal is basically for Web based trading , all the user interfaces will be thru the browser  (IE 5.0 & above) for web based functionalities. All other user interface will thru the client terminal connected to the Tandem machine.

3.2.2	Hardware Interfaces
Windows NT server will be the hardware interface for Tandem machine requests and viceversa
for Tandem end.

3.2.3	Software Interfaces

3.2.4	3.2.4 Communication Interfaces

·	A 2MBps dedicated leased line connecting the transaction server and the Local Area Network from which BOOE members will log in. 
·	A web server collocated at an ISP connected by a 2 MBPS dedicated leased line to the transaction server for enabling Internet trading. There will be web server collocated at another ISP also connected by another 2 MBPS dedicated leased line to the transaction server so that if one ISP’s system is down, system will keep functioning through another ISP. 

3.3	Performance requirements

·	The solution and system being provided by SSIT will be sized suitably to take care of at least 50000 orders per day in a 5 hour working environment, with peak load being 5 times the normal load. Such spike will be sustained for a maximum of 30 minutes at a stretch with not more than 3 such spikes during the trading day, each separated by an hour. The end-to-end transaction response time, as measured on a terminal connected on a LAN within the BOOE’s premises at Vashi should be about 2 seconds at the 95th percentile. For transactions outside this LAN in Mumbai through internet access via a 128 KBPS ISDN connection or 56 KBPS dial up connection the transaction time is estimated to be about 3 to 4 seconds in the 95th percentile which may vary depending on the accessors’ individual internet service providers’ level of service, traffic, bandwidth conditions, terminal equipments etc. 
·	However, the system should be immediately scaled up as soon as the system crosses 75 % capacity utilisation on an average for 30 consecutive trading days, so as to ensure that there is no degradation in the above-specified response time.
         
3.4	Design Constraints

Balancing the performance of Tandem with respect to the Windows NT platform;
Handling of requests/responses in  heterogeneous environment 

3.4.1	Standards Compliance

Standards that will be followed in the project will conform to SSIT QMS.
For those standards where the client has specific requirements, corresponding standards will be followed

3.4.2	Hardware Limitations

Any additional processor on tandem requires the addition of a new cabinet 
K series server used for development is a lower end machine, when compared to S series
	Firewall needs to reside on a separate NT server.
	
               
3.5	Attributes

3.5.1	Availability

The implemented system in the production environment needs to be available with a very less down time.

3.5.2	Security

The trading system through Internet will be compatible to Virtual Private Network ( VPN) which can be set up by BOOE or any group of members and traders authorized by BOOE. 

Internet security: 
SSIT will at its own cost provide suitable security measures such as firewall or equivalent measure to prevent unauthorised use or hacking of trading system. They will also implement suitable Secure socket layer and encryption and decryption technology (at least of 54 bit encryption) for providing Internet security. 
3.5.3	Maintainability 

As at present, the requirements will cover the aspects wherein the complete system is easily maintainable.

3.5.4	Transferability/Conversion

The developed portal will undergo acceptance testing at the BOOE facility and will be transferable 

Other Requirements
3.5.5	Statutory and Regulatory requirements

If the performance of this Agreement is prevented by reason of: fire, flood, earthquakes or other acts of God or on account of any labour unrest, strikes, bandhs, riots or on account of any legal statutory or regulatory directive that may come into force, the party so affected, upon prompt written notice to the other Party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent such performance is found to be prevented, provided however that the affected party shall resume performance hereunder as soon as the cause is removed.

3.5.6	Data Base

	 SSIT will develop test cases and test database for system testing. Test cases will be executed and defects will be recorded. Defect reports will be handed over to development team. After fixing these defects system will be tested again. This cycle of testing & defect fixing will be continued until removal of all known defects.

3.5.7	Operations

	During the development, CRMG will have the backup of  the development server taken as per their procedure

3.5.8	Site Adaptation

Version maintenance between implementation and development will be in sync. This is ensured thru the usage of  Visual Source Safe for Software release and maintenance.
