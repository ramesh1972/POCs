Changes to Morten's JavaScript Tree Menu v2.3.0 (2001-04-30):

	- MTMSubsGetPlus is now a tri-state option with three possible values;
	  always, never and submenu.
	- Cookie support is added, saving the state of the menu for a specified
	  number of days.  Limits the tree to around 4000 items.
	- Support for Netscape 6 and partial support for Opera 5.
	- Arguments to MTMakeSubmenu() to define whether the sub menu is expanded
	  as well as icons for open & closed state.
	- Re-written the inline style sheet so it does not duplicate any
	  information already found in the HTML code.
	- Status bar message changed to "Expand/Collapse " and the item's text.
	  Any link with a URL to a document will have said URL shown in the
	  status bar instead of any message provided by the menu.
	- Variables for headers & footers (HTML) in the menu document.
	- Tracking of local files in Microsoft Internet Explorer fixed.
	- Fixed a bug in which the menu didn't track URLs with query strings.
	- Tooltips, through usage of the TITLE attribute.
	- General code changes going towards object orientation and code that
	  is more flexible and easier to work with.
