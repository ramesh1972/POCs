"<p class='para'>This platform is designed solely for contextual online" +
"advertising. Contextual advertising is a" +
"method by which certain text or words on a web page are highlighted. When a" +
"user moves the mouse over these highlighted words, a popup window is displayed" +
"in place in which there will be one or more advertisements displayed. The words" +
"that are highlighted are picked from keywords present in the" +
"&quot;adPlusPlus.com&quot; database. </p>" +
"" +
"<p class='para'>So if you want to publish web site/pages advertised you need" +
"to get your keywords and description of your product/service for every page of" +

"<p class='para_title'>2) This advertising platform is free of cost.</p>" +
"" +
"<p class='para'>We do not charge anything from publishers who want to market" +

"and the subscriber. This implicitly means that only web site owners who want to" +
"market their site and at the same time willing to display contextual advertisements" +

"sites temporarily become yours, i.e. they to your" +

"<p class='para'>We automatically map the keywords of your advertisements to" +
