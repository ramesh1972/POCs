        "<p class='para'>The <img src='images/adplusplus2.png' width=116 height=18/></span> platform is designed solely for contextual online " +
        "advertising. Contextual advertising is a " +
        "method by which certain text or words on a web page are highlighted. When a " +
        "user moves the mouse over these highlighted words, a popup window is displayed next to the keyword. " +
        "In this popup there will be one or more advertisements related to the keyword are displayed. The words " +
        "that are highlighted are matched with keywords present in the " +
        "<img src='images/adplusplus2.png' width=116 height=18/> database. </p>" +
        "<p class='para'>So if you want to publish web site/pages advertised you need " +
        "to get your keywords and description of your product/service for every page of " +
        "yours you want to advertise. Since we are highlighting text on the web pages of subscribers, it is " +
        "directly based on its content and hence is called contextual.</p>" +

        "their website. So we do NOT pay subscribers for each click or a bunch of clicks " +
        "like other contextual advertising sites. So how do we attract web sites owners to display your " +
        "advertisements? The answer is quite simple,</p> " +
        "<p class='para_key_lines'>&quot;In order for you to publish your advertisements, you should subscribe to others advertisements as " +
        "well.&quot;</p>" +
        "<p class='para'>So there is a symbiotic relationship between the publisher " +
        "and the subscriber. This implicitly means that only web site owners who want to " +

        "will be the users of this platform. And so all the users of all these web " +
