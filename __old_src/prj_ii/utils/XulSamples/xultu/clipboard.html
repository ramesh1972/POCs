<h2>Using the Clipboard</h2>

<P>
This section provides information about cutting, copying and pasting to and from
the clipboard.
</P>

<H3>The Clipboard</H3>

<P>
Mozilla provides a number of interfaces for accessing the clipboard. The component
'@mozilla.org/widget/clipboardhelper;1' can be used to copy text to the clipboard.
This component implements the interface nsIClipboardHelper, which has a function
copyString which can be used to copy a string.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>
  const gClipboardHelper = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboardhelper;1"]
    .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIClipboardHelper);
  gClipboardHelper.copyString("Put me on the clipboard, please.");</PRE></DIV>



<P>
This example will first create a clipboard helper and then copy a short string to
the clipboard. This method only works to put strings on the clipboard. For other
types of data, such as URLs or images, you will need to use a more complex method.
</P>

<P>
A component '@mozilla.org/widget/clipboard;1' and an interface nsIClipboard
provide general access to the system clipboard. You can use it to copy and paste
any type of data from your application to the clipboard. Three XPCOM objects are
needed to handle clipboard operations. The first is an object that holds the data
to put on the clipboard. The second is the clipboard object. The third is an object
which is used to transfer the data from the first object to the clipboard. The
clipboard model in Mozilla requires you to perform the following steps to copy data:
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Create an XPCOM wrapper for the data which you want to put on the clipboard.
      This is needed because you can put anything on the clipboard from text to
      images.</LI>
  <LI>Create a transferring object. This object can be the component
      "@mozilla.org/widget/transferable;1" which implements the interface
      nsITransferable.</LI>
  <LI>Tell the transferring object about the type of data being copied.</LI>
  <LI>Tell the transferring object about the data to copy.</LI>
  <LI>Create a clipboard object which refers to the system clipboard.</LI>
  <LI>Tell the clipboard object to copy the data using the transferring object.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
You might wonder why a transferring object is needed instead of just putting the
object directly on the clipboard. One reason is that some systems do not copy the
data right away. Instead, they wait until the data is pasted. Another reason is
that the transferable can hold multiple representations of the same data. For
example, a piece of HTML can be represented in both its original HTML form and in
plain text. If an application wants to get the data from the clipboard and
doesn't understand HTML, it can use the plain text version. If it does understand
HTML, it can grab that version. The transferring object will hold the clipboard
contents until the application has decided what it needs. This allows the
clipboard to be used by another application right away.
</P>

<P>
Let's break down the steps needed to copy data to the clipboard. First, we need
to create an XPCOM object to wrap what we want to copy. We'll assume that we want
to copy some text. We will use the interface nsISupportsString which can be used
to represent strings (specifically, Unicode strings).
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var copytext="Text to copy";
var str = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/supports-string;1"].
            createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsISupportsString);
str.data=copytext;</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The first line holds the text that we want to copy. Next, the variable 'str' is
assigned to a component that can be used to hold a string. The third line assigns
the string to the component using the <SPAN CLASS="attrib">data</SPAN> property.
Here, the string "Text to copy" will be copied but you can replace this with the
text string that you want to copy. Now that we have the object to copy, a
transferring object needs to be created:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var trans = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/transferable;1"].
              createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsITransferable);
trans.addDataFlavor("text/unicode");
trans.setTransferData("text/unicode",str,copytext.length * 2);</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The first line gets the transferring component which implements nsITransferable.
Next, we need to tell the transferable what type of data we want to use. The
type of data is referred to as a data flavor. The function
<SPAN CLASS="attrib">addDataFlavor</SPAN> is used to tell the transferable that
it needs to transfer data of a certain flavour. In this case, we are transferring
the flavor "text/unicode" which is a Unicode string. Then, the function
<SPAN CLASS="attrib">setTransferData</SPAN> is called which copies the data from
the string into the transferable. This function takes three parameters. The
first is the flavor we are setting, the second is the object holding the string
and the third is the length of the data, in bytes. Here, the length is
multiplied by two because we are using a Unicode string which requires two bytes
per character.
</P>

<P>
You can repeat the last two lines and call <SPAN CLASS="attrib">addDataFlavor</SPAN>
and <SPAN CLASS="attrib">setTransferData</SPAN> for multiple flavors. That way,
you could have a text version and an HTML version of the content. The Transferable
object will hold its own copy of the data. When you've added all the flavors you
want, you can put it all on the clipboard at once. The transferable object will
hold all of the data that you want until you're ready to put it on the clipboard.
</P>

<P>
Next, we need to create a clipboard object that refers to the system clipboard.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>
var clipid = Components.interfaces.nsIClipboard;
var clip = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboard;1"].getService(clipid);
clip.setData(trans,null,clipid.kGlobalClipboard);</PRE></DIV>



<P>
We get the system clipboard object and store it in the clip variable. We can copy
the data to the clipboard by calling the function
<SPAN CLASS="attrib">setData</SPAN>. The first parameter of this function is the
transferable. The second parameter can usually be set to null but you could set it
to a nsIClipboardOwner so that you can tell when the data you've copied is
overwritten by another copy operation. Call <SPAN CLASS="attrib">setData</SPAN>
only when you're ready to copy to the system clipboard.
</P>

<P>
The third parameter to setData (and the parameter to emptyClipboard) indicates
which clipboard buffer to use. The above code uses the constant kGlobalConstant
for this, which refers to the global clipboard. This would be the same one that
cut and paste operations from the Edit menu typically use. If you use
kSelectionClipboard instead, you will copy into the selection buffer, which is
generally only available on Unix systems.
</P>

<P>
This multi-step process has resulted in text being copied on the clipboard. We
can cut to the clipboard instead of copying by doing a copy and then deleting
the original data. Normally, the text would be in a document or textbox. The
code is put together below, with additional error checking:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var copytext="Text to copy";

var str = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/supports-string;1"].
            createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsISupportsString);
if (!str) return false;
str.data = copytext;

var trans = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/transferable;1"].
              createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsITransferable);
if (!trans) return false;

trans.addDataFlavor("text/unicode");
trans.setTransferData("text/unicode",str,copytext.length * 2);

var clipid = Components.interfaces.nsIClipboard;
var clip = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboard;1"].getService(clipid);
if (!clip) return false;

clip.setData(trans,null,clipid.kGlobalClipboard);</PRE></DIV>



<H3>Pasting Clipboard Contents</H3>

<P>
To paste data from the clipboard we can use a similar process, except we use 
<SPAN CLASS="attrib">getData</SPAN> instead of <SPAN CLASS="attrib">setData</SPAN>
and <SPAN CLASS="attrib">getTransferData</SPAN> instead of 
<SPAN CLASS="attrib">setTransferData</SPAN>. Here are the steps to pasting:
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Create a clipboard object which refers to the system clipboard.</LI>
  <LI>Create a transferring object which implements the nsITransferable interface.</LI>
  <LI>Tell the transferring object about the flavor of data you want to get.</LI>
  <LI>Retrieve the data from the clipboard and put it in the transferable.</LI>
  <LI>Get the data from the transferring object.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The first steps are similar to that used for copying:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var clip = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboard;1"].
             getService(Components.interfaces.nsIClipboard);
if (!clip) return false;

var trans = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/widget/transferable;1"].
              createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsITransferable);
if (!trans) return false;
trans.addDataFlavor("text/unicode");</PRE></DIV>



<P>
This code gets the system clipboard object and a transferable object. The flavor
is added to the transferable. Next, we need to get the data from the clipboard:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>clip.getData(trans,clip.kGlobalClipboard);

var str = new Object();
var strLength = new Object();

trans.getTransferData("text/unicode",str,strLength);</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The first line performs the opposite of <SPAN CLASS="attrib">getData</SPAN>. The
data currently on the system clipboard is placed into the transferable. Next we
create two JavaScript objects which will hold the data and the length of the data.
Note that we have no idea what type of data is currently on the clipboard. It may
have been placed there by another application. This is why we use generic Objects
for <SPAN CLASS="attrib">str</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="attrib">strLength</SPAN>.
</P>

<P>
Then we use <SPAN CLASS="attrib">getTransferData</SPAN> to retrieve the data from
the transferable. We specify the flavor we would like to get. The data will be
converted if it is not of the desired flavor and a conversion between the actual
and desired flavor is possible. If you originally copied data of multiple flavors
onto the clipboard, you can retrieve the data in the best format necessary. For
example, a textbox would accept text/unicode (or text/plain) while a Composer
window might accept HTML and image data.
</P>

<P>
The variable <SPAN CLASS="attrib">str</SPAN> now holds the data from the clipboard.
We need to convert the data back into a JavaScript string from an XPCOM object.
The code below can be used for this purpose:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>if (str) str = str.value.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsISupportsString);
if (str) pastetext = str.data.substring(0,strLength.value / 2);</PRE></DIV>



<P>
Because the data from the transferable is a nsISupportsString, we need to convert
it into a JavaScript string. The property <SPAN CLASS="attrib">value</SPAN> of the
object filled in by <SPAN CLASS="attrib">getTransferData</SPAN>, which is
<SPAN CLASS="aval">str</SPAN> in this case, provides the actual value of the
object.
</P>

<P>
We assign the string to the variable <SPAN CLASS="attrib">pastetext</SPAN>.
We can then put that into a textbox or other location as necessary.
</P>
