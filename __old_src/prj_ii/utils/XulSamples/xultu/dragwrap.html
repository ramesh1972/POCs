<h2>Drag and Drop JavaScript Wrapper</h2>

<P>
This section describes how to use the JavaScript wrapper for drag and drop.
</P>

<H3>The JavaScript Drag and Drop Wrapper</H3>

<P>
The JavaScript wrapper to drag and drop simplifies the process by handling
all of the XPCOM interfaces for you. It works by providing an object which
implements the event handlers. All you have to do is write some simpler
functions which work with the data being dragged.
</P>

<P>
This drag and drop interface is stored in the global package, in the file
'chrome://global/content/nsDragAndDrop.js'. You can include this file in your
XUL file with the <A CLASS="tag" HREF="/references/elemref/ref_script.html">script</A> tag in the same way you
would include your own scripts. The library also depends on another script
libraries, which you should also include, usually at the top of your
XUL file. You can look at the contents of these files to see how drag and drop
is done at a lower level.
</P>

<P>
Note that you can only use these libraries from within XUL loaded via a
chrome URL.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>&lt;script src="chrome://global/content/nsDragAndDrop.js"/&gt;
&lt;script src="chrome://global/content/nsTransferable.js"/&gt;</PRE></DIV>



<P>
This drag and drop library creates an object stored in the variable nsDragAndDrop.
The object contains a series of functions, one for each event handler (except
for dragenter where it has nothing special to do). Each of the functions takes
two parameters, the first is the event object and the second is an observer
object that you create. More on that in a moment.
</P>

<P>
The following is an example of calling the nsDragAndDrop object.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>&lt;button label="Drag Me" ondraggesture="nsDragAndDrop.startDrag(event,buttonObserver);</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The function 'startDrag' will be called when a drag starts on the button.
The first parameter is the event object, available in all event handlers.
The second parameter to this function is the observer, which we'll create
soon. In this case we only do anything special when the button drag is started.
If we wanted to handle the other cases also, we can call the other
functions, as in the next example:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>&lt;description value="Click and drag this text."
         ondraggesture="nsDragAndDrop.startDrag(event,textObserver)"
         ondragover="nsDragAndDrop.dragOver(event,textObserver)"
         ondragexit="nsDragAndDrop.dragExit(event,textObserver)"
         ondragdrop="nsDragAndDrop.drop(event,textObserver)"/></PRE></DIV>



<P>
As mentioned earlier, there is nothing special that happens during a
dragenter event, so you can just write that yourself.
</P>

<P>
The functions are implemented by the nsDragAndDrop object, which is declared
in the file nsDragAndDrop.js, which was included in one of the
<A CLASS="tag" HREF="/references/elemref/ref_script.html">script</A> tags. They handle the event, handle the XPCOM
interfaces and pass a simpler data structure to functions of the observer
object.
</P>

<P>
The observer is an object that you declare yourself. In the above examples, this
observer is stored in the buttonObserver and textObserver variables. The observer
is declared in a script which you would include in the XUL file using the 
<A CLASS="tag" HREF="/references/elemref/ref_script.html">script</A> tag. The observer is an object which may have a
number of properties, each set to a function which handles a particular aspect of
drag and drop. Five functions may be defined. You only have to define the
ones that you need.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>onDragStart (event , transferData, action)</B><BR>
      Define this function to have something happen when a drag starts. It
      takes three arguments, the event object as was originally passed to the
      event handler, the data to drag and the type of drag action. This function
      should add the data to drag to the transferData object.</LI>
  <LI><B>onDragOver (event, flavour, session)</B><BR>
      This function should be defined when you want something to happen
      when an element is dragged over. The first argument is the event
      object, the second is the flavour of the data and the third is a drag
      session object which provides more details about the drag that is
      occurring. You should define this function for elements that allow dragged
      data to be dropped on them.</LI>
  <LI><B>onDragExit (event, session)</B><BR>
      This function should be defined when something should happen on a drag
      exit. It has two arguments, the event object and the drag session.</LI>
  <LI><B>onDrop (event, dropData, session)</B><BR>
      This function should be defined when you want something to happen when
      an object is dropped. The first argument is the event object and the
      second is the data being dragged. The third argument is the drag session.</LI>
  <LI><B>getSupportedFlavours ( )</B><BR>
      This function should return a list of flavours that the object being
      dragged over can accept. This function takes no arguments. This
      function is necessary so that the wrapper can determine the best
      flavour to pass to the other functions.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For an observer that is observing an element that can start a drag, you should
define at least the onDragStart function. For elements that can have objects
dropped on them, you should define onDragOver, onDrop and getSupportedFlavours
(and, if desired, onDragExit).
</P>

<P>
The type of data being dragged is stored as a set of flavours. Often, a dragged
object will be available in a number of flavours. That way, a drop target can
accept the flavour it finds most suitable. For example, a file may come in two
flavours, the file itself and the text name of the file. If the file is dragged
and dropped onto a directory, the file flavour will be used. If the file is
dropped onto a textbox, the text name flavour will be used. The text is
therefore used to insert the name of the file when files can't be dropped
directly.
</P>

<P>
A flavour object has a name, which is a formatted like a MIME type, such as
'text/unicode'. Within the onDragStart function, you specify what flavours are
available for the item being dragged. To do this, add data and flavours to 
the transferData object, which is the second argument to onDragStart.
</P>

<P>
An example should help here. The onDragStart function adds data to the transferData
object.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var textObserver = {
  onDragStart: function (evt , transferData, action){
    var htmlText="&lt;strong&gt;Cabbage&lt;/strong&gt;";
    var plainText="Cabbage";

    transferData.data=new TransferData();
    transferData.data.addDataForFlavour("text/html",htmlText);
    transferData.data.addDataForFlavour("text/unicode",plainText);
  }
};
</PRE></DIV>



<P>
Here, an observer has been declared and stored in the variable 'textObserver'.
It has one property called onDragStart. (In JavaScript, properties can be
declared with the syntax name : value). This property is a function which
sets the data that is being dragged.
</P>

<P>
Once called, it starts a drag for the string data "Cabbage". Of course, you
would want to calculate this value from the element that was clicked on.
Conveniently, this element is available from the event
object's target property. The event object is passed as the first
argument to onDragStart.
</P>

<P>
We create a TransferData object which can be used to hold all the data to be
dragged. We add two pieces of data to the transfer data. The first is a string
of HTML text and the second is a string of plain text. If the user drops onto
an area which can accept HTML (such as Mozilla's editor window), the HTML flavour
will be used and the text will appear bold. Otherwise, the plain text version
will be used instead.
</P>

<P>
Usually you will want to provide a text version of the data so that more
applications can accept the data. The order that you define the flavours
should be from the best match to the weakest match. In this case above, the
HTML flavour (text/html) comes first and then the text flavour (text/unicode).
</P>

<P>
The example below shows how to set the data to be dragged from the
element's <SPAN CLASS="attrib">label</SPAN> attribute. In this case we only
provide the data in one flavour.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var textObserver = {
  onDragStart: function (evt){
    var txt=evt.target.getAttribute("label");

    transferData.data=new TransferData();
    transferData.data.addDataForFlavour("text/unicode",txt);
  }
}</PRE></DIV>



<P>
This might be useful when implementing drag and drop for cells in a tree.
You can use the value of a cell, or some resource from an RDF file if the
tree is built from a template, as the value of a drag. If you store it as
a string, any object that accepts strings dragged onto it can grab the
dragged data.
</P>

<P>
You will need to add an observer to each element that can either start a
drag action or can accept dropped objects. You can reuse the same observer
for multiple elements. For an element that can start a drag, onStartDrag
is all that is necessary to implement.
</P>

<P>
For an element that can be dropped on, the observer will need to implement
at least the getSupportedFlavours, onDragOver and onDrop functions. Some
elements may be able to initiate a drag and accept a drop. In this case,
the onStartDrag function will be necessary as well.
</P>

<P>
The getSupportedFlavours function should return a list of flavours that
the element being dragged over can accept for dropping. A file system
directory view might accept files and perhaps text, but wouldn't accept
HTML text. Below, we'll define a getSupportedFlavours function. We'll
allow only one flavour here, that for a string.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var textObserver = {
  getSupportedFlavours : function () {
    var flavours = new FlavourSet();
    flavours.appendFlavour("text/unicode");
    return flavours;
  }
}</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The flavours list contains only one flavour, which is 'text/unicode'.
The FlavourSet object can be used to hold a list of flavours. In some
cases, you must provide the XPCOM interface as well. For example, for
files:
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var textObserver = {
  getSupportedFlavours : function () {
    var flavours = new FlavourSet();
    flavours.appendFlavour("application/x-moz-file","nsIFile");
    flavours.appendFlavour("text/unicode");
    return flavours;
  }
}</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The onDragOver function defines what happens when an object is dragged over.
You might use it to change the appearance of the element as it is being dragged
over. In many cases the function can do nothing. It must be defined for elements
that accept dragged data however.
</P>

<P>
Next, the onDrop function should be created. Its second argument is the transfer
data object that holds the data being dragged. By the time onDrop is called, the
wrapper has called getSupportedFlavours to determine the best flavour for the
drop, so the transfer object only contains the data for the best matching flavour.
</P>

<P>
The transfer object has two properties, 'data' which holds the data and 'flavour'
which holds the flavour of the data. Once you have the data, you can add it to the
element is some way. For example, you might set the value of a textbox.
</P>


<DIV CLASS="sample"><PRE>var textObserver = {
  onDrop : function (evt, transferData, session) {
    event.target.setAttribute("value",transferData.data);
  }
}</PRE></DIV>



<P>
The flavour system used allows multiple objects of various types to be
dragged at once and also allows alternative forms of the data to be
dragged. The following table describes some of the flavours you might
use. You can also make up your own flavours if necessary.
</P>
