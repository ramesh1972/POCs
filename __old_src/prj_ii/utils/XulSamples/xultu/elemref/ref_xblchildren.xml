  Specifies the location where any child elements of the bound element are  placed in the generated content.        Normally, if the element bound to has its own content, the anonymous content  is not generated. However, with a children element, you can merge the  content from the XUL element and the XBL content.        If the children tag contains content itself, that content will become the default  content. If the element the binding is attached to contains content, the default  content will be ignored. If the element does not contain content, the default  content will be added.
