<element name='statusbarpanel'>
<reference>http://www.xulplanet.com/reference/elemref/ref_statusbarpanel.html</reference>
  An individual element of a statusbar. This is a special type of button  which is drawn differently. Unlike normal buttons, a statusbarpanel can only  have a label or an image but not both. This element is often used with a  short label or icon to indicate status, for instance whether the user is  online or whether there are new messages.  

<attr name='crop'>
  If the label of the statusbarpanel is too small to fit in its given space, the  text will be cropped on the side specified by the crop attribute.  An ellipsis will be used in place of the cropped text. If the box  direction is reversed, the cropping is reversed.
<value name='start'>
    The text will be cropped on its left side. 
</value>
<value name='end'>
    The text will be cropped on its right side.

</value>
<value name='none'>

    alignment.
