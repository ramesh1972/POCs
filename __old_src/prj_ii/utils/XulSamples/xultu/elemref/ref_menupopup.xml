<method name='showPopup'>
<prototype> showPopup ( element, x , y , popupType, anchor, align ) </prototype>
  
  Opens a popup window. There are two ways of specifying where the popup  appears, either at a specific screen position, or relative to some element  in the window. If either x and y are set to values, the popup will  appear at the screen coordinate (x,y). If x and y are -1, the popup will be  positioned relative to the element specified as the first argument. This is  what you might do to show a popup underneath a button for example. In this  latter case, the anchor and align arguments may be used to further control  where the popup appears relative to the element.  The anchor argument  corresponds to the popupanchor attribute on the element. The align argument  corresponds to the popupalign attribute on the element. The anchor and align  attributes are ignored if either x or y are not -1.        To have a popup appear relative to another element yet still be offset by  some number of pixels, determine the actual screen position of the element  using the boxObject.screenX and boxObject.screenY properties of the element  and use those as the x and y arguments offset by the desired values.        Type should be either the string "popup", "context" or "tooltip". Each type  of popup is intended to be displayed only temporarily; they are not excepted  to be displayed permanently. Only one popup may be displayed at a time. This  example will open the popup anchored on the bottom-left corner of the button  someButton:         menupopup.showPopup (someButton,-1,-1,"popup","bottomleft","topleft");    
</method>
<method name='sizeTo'>
<prototype> sizeTo ( width , height ) </prototype>
  
  Changes the current size of the popup to a new width and height.
</method>
