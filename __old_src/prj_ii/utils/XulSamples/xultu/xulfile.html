<h2>XUL Structure</h2>

<P>
We'll begin by looking at how the XUL is handled in Mozilla.
</P>

<H3>How XUL is Handled</H3>

<P>
In Mozilla, XUL is handled much in the same way that HTML is handled. When
you type the URL of an HTML page into the browser's address field, the
browser locates the web site and downloads the content. The Mozilla rendering
engine takes the content in the form of HTML source and transforms it into a
document tree. The tree is then converted into a set of objects that can
be displayed on the screen.
<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, images and other
technologies are used to control the presentation. XUL functions in much the
same way.
</P>

<P>
In fact, in Mozilla, all document types, whether they are HTML or XUL, or
even SVG are all handled by the same underlying code. This means that the same
CSS properties may be used to style both HTML and XUL, and many of the
features can be shared between both. However, there are some features that are
specific to HTML such as forms, and others which are specific to XUL such as
overlays.
</P>

<P>
Since XUL and HTML are handled in the same way, you can load both from either
your local file system or from a web page. In addition, Mozilla provides a
special way of installing and registering files as part of its chrome system.
This involves creating an archive of the files which the user would download
and install. These registered packages have enhanced privileges such as being
able to read files, examine user preferences and bookmarks and access other
system features. Obviously, web pages do not get these privileges, unless they
are signed with a digital certificate and the user has granted these
applications permission.
</P>

<P>
The package registration is the way in which Firefox Extensions are able to
add features to the browser. The extensions are small packages of XUL files,
Javascript, style sheets and images packed together into a single file. This
file can be created by using a ZIP utility. When the user downloads it, it
will be installed onto the user's machine. It will hook into the browser using
a XUL specific feature called an overlay which allows the XUL from the
extension and the XUL in the browser to combine together. To the user, it may
seem like the extension has modified the browser, but in reality, the code is
all separate, and the extension may be uninstalled easily.
</P>

<P>
Registered packages are not required to use overlays, of course. If they
don't, you won't be able to access them via the main browser interface, but
you can still access them via a special kind of URL, designed specifically
for accessing installed packages. This kind of URL is called a chrome URL and
it always begins with 'chrome://'. Much like how the 'http://' URL always
refers to remote web sites, and the 'file://' URL always refers to local
files, the 'chrome://' URL always refers to installed packages and extensions.
We'll look more at the syntax of a chrome URL in the next section.
</P>

<P>
It is important to note that when accessing content through a chrome URL, it
gains the enhanced privileges described above that other kinds of URLs do not.
For instance, an HTTP URL does not have any special privileges and an error
will occur if a web page tries, for example, to read a local file. However, a
file loaded via a chrome URL will be able to read files without restriction.
</P>

<P>
This distinction is important. This means that there are certain things that
content of web pages cannot do, such as read the user's bookmarks. This
distinction is <em>not</em> based on the kind of content being displayed; only
on the type of URL used. Both HTML and XUL placed on a web site have no extra
permissions; however both HTML and XUL loaded through a chrome URL have
enhanced permissions.
</P>

<P>
It is worth noting that the Mozilla browser itself is actually just a set of
packages containing XUL files, JavaScript and style sheets. These files are
accessed via a chrome URL and have enhanced privileges and work just like any
other package. Of course, the browser is much larger and more sophisticated
than most extensions. Mozilla's mail client, composer, Firefox and Thunderbird
as well as number of other components are all written in XUL and are all
accessible via chrome URLs.
</P>

<P>
If you are going to use XUL on a web site, you can just put the XUL file
on the web site as you would an HTML file, and then load its URL in a
browser. Ensure that your web server is configured to send XUL files with
the content type of 'application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml'. This content type
is how Mozilla knows the difference between HTML and XUL. Mozilla does not
use the file extension, unless reading files from the file system, but you
should use the .xul extension for all XUL files. You can load XUL files from
your own machine by opening them in the browser, or by double-clicking the
file in your file manager. Remember that remote XUL will have significant
restrictions on what it can do.
</P>

<P>
Currently, work is ongoing to allow XUL applications to be created as
standalone applications which have their own installers and executables. While
they will share Mozilla libraries, you will not need to have a browser
installed in order to use XUL. It is actually somewhat possible to do this
today, but the process is rather complicated and rarely done. The goal is to
streamline this process.
</P>

<P>
While much of the functionality is shared between HTML and XUL, Mozilla uses
a distinctly different kind of document object for each. There are three
main types of document in Mozilla: HTML, XML and XUL. Naturally, the HTML
document is used for HTML documents, the XUL document is used for XUL
documents, and the XML document is used for other types of XML documents.
Since XUL is also XML, the XUL document is a subtype of the more generic XML
document. There are subtle differences in functionality. For example while the
form controls on an HTML page are accessible via the 'document.forms'
property, this property isn't available for XUL documents since XUL doesn't
have forms in the HTML sense. On the other hand, XUL specific features such as
overlays and templates are only available in XUL documents.
</P>

<P>
This distinction between documents is important. It is possible to use many
XUL features in HTML or XML documents since they aren't document type specifc,
however other features require the right kind of document. For instance, you
can use the XUL layout types in other documents since they don't rely on the
XUL document type to function.
</P>

<P>
To summarize the points made above:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Mozilla renders both HTML and XUL using the same underlying engine and
      uses CSS to specify their presentation.</LI>
  <LI>XUL may be loaded from a remote site, the local file system, or
      installed as a package and accessed using a chrome URL. This is what
      browser extensions do.</LI>
  <LI>Chrome URLs may be used to access installed packages and open them with
      enhanced privileges.</LI>
  <LI>HTML, XML and XUL each have a different document type. Some features may
      be used in any document type whereas some features are specific to one
      kind of document.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The next few sections describe the basic structure of a chrome package which
can be installed into Mozilla. However, if you just want to get started
building a simple application, you may skip ahead to
<a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/tutorials/xultu/window.html">section 2</a>
and save this section for later.
</P>

<H3>Package Organization</H3>

<P>
Mozilla is organized in such a way that you can have as many components
as you want installed. A typical installation might have the navigator,
messenger and editor components. It will also have one component for each
installed skin and locale. Each of these components, or packages, is made
up of a set of files that describe the user interface for it. For example,
the messenger component will have descriptions of the mail messages list
window, the composition window and the address book dialogs.
</P>

<P>
The packages that are provided with Mozilla are located within the chrome
directory, which you will find in the directory where you installed Mozilla.
The chrome directory is where you will find all the files that describe the
user interface used by the Mozilla browser, mail client and other
applications. Rather confusingly, the directory is called 'chrome' but is only
marginally related to the chrome URL. Just copying a file into the 'chrome'
directory doesn't give the file any extra permissions nor can it be accessed
via a chrome URL. The only way to create content that can be accessed through
a chrome URL is by creating a package as described in the next few sections.
This directory is called 'chrome' likely because it seemed like a convenient
name to use for the directory where the chrome packages that are included with
Mozilla are kept.
</P>

<P>
To further the confusion, there are two other places where the word chrome
might appear. The first is the '-chrome' command line argument, and the
chrome modifier to the 'window.open' function. Neither of these features
grant extra privileges; instead they are used to open a new top-level window
without the browser UI such as the menu and toolbar. You will commonly use
this feature in more complex XUL applications since you wouldn't want a
browser to exist around your dialog boxes.
</P>

<P>
The files for a package are usually combined into a single JAR file. A JAR
file may created and examined using a ZIP utility. For instance, open some of
the JAR files in Mozilla's chrome directory to see the basic structure of a
package. Although it's normal to combine the files into a JAR file, packages
may also be accessed in expanded form as a set of directories. Although you
don't normally distribute a package this way, it is handy during development
since you can edit the file directory and then reload the XUL file without
having to repackage or reinstall.
</P>

<P>
There are usually three different parts to a chrome package, although they are
all optional. Each part is stored in a different directory. These three sets
are the content, the skin and the locale, described below. A particular
package might provide one or more skins and locales, but a user can replace
them with their own. In addition, the package might include several different
applications each accessible via different chrome URLs. The packaging system
is flexible enough so that you can include whatever parts you need, and allow
other parts, such as the text for different languages, to be downloaded
separately.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Content</B> - Windows and scripts<BR>
      The declarations of the windows and the user interface elements
      contained within them. These are stored in XUL files, which
      have a xul extension. A content package can have multiple XUL files,
      but the main window should have a filename that is the same as the
      package name. For example, the editor package will have a file
      within it called editor.xul. Scripts are placed in separate files
      alongside the XUL files.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Skin</B> - Style sheets, images and other theme specific files<BR>
      Style sheets describe details of the appearance of a window. They
      are stored separately from XUL files to facilitate modifying
      the skin (theme) of an application. Any images used are stored here
      also.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Locale</B> - Locale specific files<BR>
      All the text that is displayed within a window is stored separately.
      This way, a user can have a set for their own language.
  </LI>
</UL>

<P>
Take a look at Mozilla's chrome directory. You should see a bunch of JAR files,
one for each installed package. For example, the file messenger.jar describes
the user interface for the Mail component. The file modern.jar describes
the Modern skin.
</P>

<H3>Distinguishing a Package Type</H3>

<P>
The name of the JAR file might describe what it contains, but you can't be sure
unless you view its contents. Let's use the messenger package as an example.
If you extract the files in messenger.jar, you will find that it contains a
directory structure much like the following:
</P>

<PRE>
content
   messenger
      contents.rdf
      messenger.xul
      -- other mail XUL and JS files goes here --
      addressbook
         -- address book files go here --
      messengercompose
         -- message composition files go here --
.
.
.
</PRE>

<P>
This is easily recognizable as a content package, as the top-level directory
is called 'content'. For skins, this directory will usually be called 'skin'
and for locales, it will usually be called 'locale'. Actually, this naming
scheme isn't necessary but this is a common convention to make the parts of a
package clearer. Some packages may include a content section, a skin and a
locale. In this case, you will find a subdirectory for each type. For example,
Chatzilla is distributed in this way.
</P>

<P>
The content/messenger directory contains a number of files with xul and js
extensions. The XUL files are the ones with the xul extension. The files with
js extensions are JavaScript files which contain scripts that handle the
functionality of a window. Many XUL files have a script file associated with
them, and some may have more than one.
</P>

<P>
In the listing above, two files have been shown. There are others of course,
but for simplicity they aren't shown. The file messenger.xul is the XUL file
that describes the main Mail window which displays the mail messages list.
The mail window is fairly complex so it is actually made of several files each
combined together using overlays. The main window for a content package should
have the same name as the package with a xul extension. In this case, the
package name is 'messenger', so we expect to find 'messenger.xul'. Some of the
other XUL files describe separate windows. For example, the file subscribe.xul
describes the dialog for subscribing to newsgroups.
</P>

<P>
The file contents.rdf is found in every package, one for each content, skin
and locale in the package. This is an important file since it specifies the
name of the package, its author and version. Mozilla will read this file and
use its contents to register the package and assign a chrome URL to it, so
that the files can be accessed through this chrome URL. Without this file,
a chrome URL cannot be assigned to the package. The details of this file will
be described in a later section.
</P>

<P>
Two subdirectories, addressbook and messengercompose, describe additional
sections of the Mail component. They are placed in different directories
only to separate them. They don't need 'contents.rdf' files because they can
be accessed through the same chrome URLs.
</P>

<H3>Skins</H3>

<P>
The underlying code of Mozilla calls them skins, although the user interface
calls them themes, but they both refer to the same thing. The modern.jar and
classic.jar files in the Mozilla chrome directory describe the themes provided
with Mozilla. Their structure is similar to the content packages. For example,
examining modern.jar:
</P>

<PRE>
skin
   modern
      navigator
         contents.rdf
         -- navigator skin files go here --
      messenger
         contents.rdf
         -- messenger skin files go here --
      editor
         contents.rdf
         -- editor skin files go here --
      communicator
         contents.rdf
         -- communicator skin files go here --
      global
         contents.rdf
         -- global skin files go here --
.
.
.
</PRE>

<P>
This is a little more complicated, although the structure is similar to the
content part. Instead of 'content' at the top level, 'skin' is used. Remember
that this is purely convention, as you can actually put all the files in one
directory at the top level and not use subdirectories. However, for larger
applications like Mozilla itself, subdirectories are used to separate the
different components. In the example above, five directories exist, one for
each package that the skin is applied to. The global directory contains skin
files that are general to all packages. These files will apply to all
components and you will usually use this one yourself. The global part defines
the appearance of all of the common XUL widgets, whereas the other directories
have files that are specific to those applications. For example, the editor
directory describes the skin for the editor component and contains, among
other files, the images for the editor toolbar buttons.
</P>

<P>
You might notice that there are five contents.rdf files. This way, the skins
are applied separately to each component. You could theoretically have a
different skin for navigator as messenger, but most of the appearance is
determined by the global part so you won't see much difference. Besides,
Mozilla provides no capability to select a different theme for each
application. They are also separate files so that new components can be added
and existing components can be removed easily. For example, you could create a
new theme for messenger and users could download it separately. By packaging
the parts separately, the right pieces can be selected for use.
</P>

<P>
A skin is made up of CSS files and a number of images used to define the
look of an interface. The file messenger.css is used by messenger.xul and
contains styles which define the appearance of various parts of the mail
interface. Again, note how the file messenger.css has the same name as the
package. By changing the CSS files, you can adjust the appearance of a window
without changing its function. This is how you can create a new theme. The XUL
part remains the same but the skin part changes independently.
</P>

<H3>Locales</H3>

<P>
The file en-US.jar describes the language information for each component, in
this case for US English. Like the skins, each language will contain files
that specify text used by the package but for a specific language. As usual, a
contents.rdf file is provided that lists the packages the locale provides text
for. Subdirectories provide the text for each package. The locale structure is
similar to the skin part, so we won't list it here.
</P>

<P>
The localized text is stored in two types of files, DTD files, and properties
files. The DTD files have a dtd extension and contain entity declarations, one
for each text string that is used in a window. For example, the file
messenger.dtd contains entity declarations for each menu command. In addition,
keyboard shortcuts for each command are also defined, because they may be
different for each language. DTD files are used by XUL files so, in general,
you will have one per XUL file. The locale part also contains properties
files, which are similar, but are used by script files. The file
messenger.properties contains a few such localized strings.
</P>

<P>
This structure allows you to translate Mozilla or a component into a different
language by just adding a new locale for that language. You don't have to
change the XUL part. In addition, another person could supply a separate
package that applies a skin or locale to your content part, thus providing
support for a new theme or language without having to change the original
package.
</P>

<H3>Other Packages</H3>

<P>
Many of the packages in Mozilla are sub-packages of the communicator package.
For example, you'll find the bookmarks window, the history viewer and the
preferences dialogs within the communicator package. They are put there
because they are general to a number of packages. There is nothing special
about them.
</P>

<P>
There is a one special package called toolkit (or global). We saw the global
directory earlier for skins. The toolkit.jar contains the corresponding content
part for it. It contains some global dialogs and definitions. It also defines
the default appearance and functionality of the various common widgets such as
textboxes and buttons. The files located in the global part of a skin package
contain the default look for all of the XUL interface elements. Most theme
changes will involve variations of these files.
</P>

<H3>Adding a Package</H3>

<P>
Mozilla places the packages that are included with the installation in the
chrome directory. However, they do not need to be placed there. If you have
another package installed, it can be placed anywhere on the disk. The file
chrome.rdf in the chrome directory stores the list of installed packages,
skins and locales and where they are located. It is common to install new
packages into the chrome directory simply because it is convenient, however
they will work just as well from another directory or somewhere on your
local network. You cannot store them on a remote site, unless the remote site
is mounted through the local file system.
</P>

<P>
A user may have multiple skins and locales installed that modify the same
package. Only one skin and locale per package is active at any given time.
The file chrome/chrome.rdf in the user profile specifies which skins and
locales are active. This file can also specify content packages. It works
similarly to the chrome.rdf file in the main Mozilla installation, however
packages specified in the profile are only installed for that user, whereas
the Mozilla directory's chrome.rdf is used for packages that are available for
all users.

In the next section, we'll look at how to refer to chrome packages using the
chrome URL.
