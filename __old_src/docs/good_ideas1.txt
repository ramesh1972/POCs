are sourceforge and freshmeat marketing sites? Looks like they are lke download.com.

long way away from selling/even thinking of releasing. I have to build support for plugins & plugons(applets & java class files for e..g). I have to kind of automate or if not log/report that the embed failed. I have already have support for this, but need to make sure editing works. I also need to work on confirmation dialogs, cookies, http-equiv refreshes (any auto refreshes), base tag(base uri and referrer uri), target windows (we need or atleast give option to open links (hrefs) on a pagelet in a new window/tab or in the same page let), may be save the http header to support anything new in the future,
and multiple selection of content. I have added support for all the other elements, frames, iframes, popups, forms, image maps, scripts, stylesheets, links(server side includes).

Actually the tough ones are done. Its only the applet(embed object) action tracking. Yet to see if it is possible. Got few ideas. 

With this i think we will have the most complete and reliable engine. It is not easy(not worth it, too complex or too cheap). I don't think anybody is going to do it with great detail.
