  Much like the HTML script element, this is used to declare a script to be  used by the XUL window. You should usually put scripts in a separate file  pointed to by the src attribute, but you may also place the script inline  inside the opening and closing script tags.  

<example>
<![CDATA[
    &lt;script src=&quot;test.js&quot;/&gt;

]]>
</example>
<attr name='src' type='script URL'>
  The URL of the script.
</attr>
<attr name='type' type='language content type'>
  The language of the script. Usually, you would set this to  'application/x-javascript'. 
</attr>
</element>
