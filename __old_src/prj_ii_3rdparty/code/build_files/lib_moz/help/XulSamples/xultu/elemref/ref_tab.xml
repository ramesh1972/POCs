<attr name='accesskey' type='character'>
  This should be set to a letter that is used as a shortcut key. This letter  should be one of the characters that appears in the label text for the tab.  This letter will typically be drawn underlined, although this behavior will  be platform and theme specific. When the user presses ALT (or a similar key  that varies on each platform) and the access key, the tab will be activated  from anywhere in the window. Although the value is case insensitive, a  letter with the case matching the accesskey attribute will used if both  cases exist in the label.
</attr>
<attr name='afterselected' type='boolean'>
  This is set to true if the tab is immediately after the currently selected tab.  This is set automatically set when needed and you shouldn't adjust it manually.  This is primarily useful for themes so that they can adjust the appearance of the  area around the selected tab.
</attr>
<attr name='beforeselected' type='boolean'>

</attr>
<attr name='crop'>
  If the label of the tab is too small to fit in its given space, the  text will be cropped on the side specified by the crop attribute.  An ellipsis will be used in place of the cropped text. If the box  direction is reversed, the cropping is reversed.

<attr name='disabled' type='boolean'>
  Indicates whether the tab is disabled or not. If this attribute is set to true,  the tab is disabled. This is usually drawn with the text in grey.

To enable the tab, leave the attribute out entirely as opposed to  setting the value to false.
