<element name='caption'>
<documentation>http://www.xulplanet.com/tutorials/xultu/titledbox.html</documentation>
<reference>http://www.xulplanet.com/reference/elemref/ref_caption.html</reference>
  A header for a groupbox. It may contain either a text label, using the  label attribute, or child elements for a more complex caption.  

<attr name='accesskey' type='character'>
  This should be set to a letter that is used as a shortcut key. This letter  should be one of the characters that appears in the label text for the caption.  This letter will typically be drawn underlined, although this behavior will  be platform and theme specific. When the user presses ALT (or a similar key  that varies on each platform) and the access key, the caption will be activated  from anywhere in the window. Although the value is case insensitive, a  letter with the case matching the accesskey attribute will used if both  cases exist in the label.
</attr>
<attr name='crop'>
  If the label of the caption is too small to fit in its given space, the  text will be cropped on the side specified by the crop attribute.  An ellipsis will be used in place of the cropped text. If the box  direction is reversed, the cropping is reversed.
