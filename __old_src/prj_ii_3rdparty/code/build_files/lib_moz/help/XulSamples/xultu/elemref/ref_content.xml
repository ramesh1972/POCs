  This element should appear inside a conditions element. A rule's conditions  should contain one and only one content element. The content element should  also have a uri attribute. It is used to bind a variable to a content node  during matching. When using a tree with the 'flags' attribute set to  'dont-build-content', use a treeitem element instead.  

<prop name='tag'>
  This may be set to a tag name. If set, the conditions will only match if the  template builder is parsing content for an element directly inside this tag.  For example, by using a value of 'treechildren', the condition will only match  when placing elements directly inside a treechildren tag. Thus, nested elements  will not match because they are directly inside a treeitem. This attribute is  useful to provide different rules for outer and inner elements.
</prop>
<prop name='uri'>
  Used to specify the variable name for the content. When a rule is  evaluated, it scans through each resource in the RDF datasource looking  for a match. Each resource is placed in the variable specified in the  uri attribute in turn. Then, the other rules are evaluated for a match.  This attribute should always be present.
