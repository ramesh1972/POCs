  A broadcaster is used whn you want multiple elements to share one or more  attribute values, or when you want elements to respond to a state change.  Any elements that are observing the broadcaster will share the attributes  placed on the broadcaster. For instance, if the broadcaster has a label  attribute, the observes will use that label. If the label changes, the  labels of the observers will update automatically. An onbroadcast event  will be sent to the observers when a change is made.        For menuitems or buttons that just want to have their disabled status set  when the feature should be disabled, you should use a command element  instead.
