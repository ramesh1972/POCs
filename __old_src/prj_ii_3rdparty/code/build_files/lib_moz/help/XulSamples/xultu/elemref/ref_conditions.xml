  This element should appear directly inside a rule element and is used to  define conditions for the rule. Within the conditions can be placed content,  member and triple elements. These may have attributes whose value is a  variable name beginning with a question mark (?). When evaluating the rule for  a particular RDF resource, the variables are replaced with values from the  resource. If all variables can be replaced, the rule matched.
